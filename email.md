Hello, 

My wife is selling hand-woven Kashmiri Pashmina scarves and shwals. 

The hand-woven pashmina scarves known for softness and warmth is perhaps the most practical in this winter given the outside temperatures. Super comfortable and warm in the current season, the hand-woven kashmiri pashmina scarf becomes a truly indispensable accessory.

What is Pashmina ? Pashmina is the most noble cashmere variety, the oldest and the most luxurious. It is the natural fibre which comes only from the Himalayan high altitutude exclusive goat(Changthangi). Making a 100% pure pashmina shawl requires around 80-170gms. Whereas, it only represents 0.5% of the world’s wool production. Original pashmina shawls are made by hand, no machines and chemicals have been used. This is a very long process hence to complete one pashmina shawl takes days to complete. The traditional artisans in Kashmir have been manufacturing the pashmina shawl for many centuries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashmina
